# MCAS: Measuring Bias in Multimodal Models: Multimodal Composite Association Score
Code for the paper: Measuring Bias in Multimodal Models: Multimodal Composite Association Score


Generative multimodal models based on diffusion models
have seen tremendous growth and advances in recent years and are being
used for information search and retrieval along with traditional search
engines. Models such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have become in-
creasingly popular, however, they can reflect social biases embedded in
training data which is often crawled from the internet. Research into bias
measurement and quantification has generally focused on small single-
stage models working on a single modality. Thus the emergence of multi-
stage multimodal models requires a different approach. In this paper,
we propose Multimodal Composite Association Score (MCAS) as a new
method of measuring bias in multimodal generative models and using
this method, uncover gender bias in DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. We
propose MCAS as an accessible and scalable method of quantifying po-
tential bias for models with different modalities and a range of potential
biases.
